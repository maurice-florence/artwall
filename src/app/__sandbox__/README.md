# Sandbox (`src/app/__sandbox__`)

This directory contains experimental, diagnostic, or demo pages that are **not** part of the production application.

## Access Control

Pages here are gated by `layout.tsx`. They only render when the environment variable:

```bash
NEXT_PUBLIC_ENABLE_SANDBOX=true
```

is present at build/runtime. Without it, all sandbox routes return a 404 via `notFound()`.

## Purpose of Pages

- `test-phase3b` – Advanced SmartFormField types demo (rich text, multiselect, color picker, date, file upload).
- `test-phase4a` – Smart form logic scenarios (conditional fields, dependencies, validation flows) using `AdminModal`.
- `test-smartfield` – Minimal SmartFormField validation showcase harness.
- `test-image-performance` – Firebase Storage resize variant performance diagnostics.

## Guidelines

1. Keep pages self-contained—avoid exporting anything consumed by production code.
2. Prefix additions clearly; remove obsolete experiments after merging validated features.
3. Do not rely on sandbox routes for automated tests; migrate stable tests into `__tests__`.
4. Avoid secrets or real content—use mock/sample data only.

## Removal / Promotion

- When a concept graduates to production, move shared components into `src/components` or feature folders.
- Delete the corresponding sandbox page and update this README.
